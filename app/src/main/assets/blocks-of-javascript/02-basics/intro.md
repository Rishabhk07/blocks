# 2. Basics and Syntax

When learning any language \(be it a programming language or a literary one\), we must start with the **grammar, **i.e. the rules that govern with. And for that, we must know what the building blocks of that language are.

Drawing an analogy from a literary language \(English\) and a programming language \(Javascript\), we can say the following -

| English | Javascript |
| :--- | :--- |
| Story | Software/App |
| Chapter | Program/Script |
| Paragraph | Function |
| Sentence | Statement |
| Word | Token |
| Alphabet | Character |

Going up the chain, let's see what these are -

#### Character

These are letters \(A-Z,a-z\), numbers \(0-9\), and special characters like !@\#$%^&\*\(\), and others. Every language will have a valid set of characters which can be used to write code. Some languages support using letters of foreign languages too. For Javascript, the _**Unicode**_ charater set is supported, with with various rules and reservations about which characters can or can not be used in different situations. 

#### Token

A token is a single meaningful unit of code. There are tokens like `var` which is a keyword for declaring variables, tokens like a simple number `10` which represents the integer 10. Symbols like + - \* / = are also tokens 

#### Statement

A statement is a single unit of code that makes sense on its own. Similar to what a sentence is in literary languages, when you put tokens together into a line of code, which can be interpreted by the interpreter and some logical step gets taken, that piece of code is called a statement. Some examples are - 

`var a = 10` which sets that value of **a ** to 10. 

`console.log('hello')`which prints the word **hello** to the screen. 

#### Function

A collection of statements, that will execute in a given order \(governed by some logic\). A process of starting the execution of the statements within a function is called _invoking_, though, more colloquially, _calling a function_ is correct.
