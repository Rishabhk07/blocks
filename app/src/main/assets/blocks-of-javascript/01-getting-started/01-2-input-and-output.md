## 1.2 Input and Output

To start learning a computer language, the first thing to understand is how to take input and give output. Because without output, you have no proof the program running, and hence no idea of how exactly the code that you are writing runs.

### 1.2.1 Output from a Javascript Program

There are many ways for the Javascript program to give an output. The easiest one is to just** print back into the console** from where the script/interpreter is running.

Simple type this line and see what happens -

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

Another way is to generate a visible alert for the user. \(This is something that works only in Browsers\).

```js
window.alert("Something happened");
```

### 1.2.2 Taking input from user

Taking input from the user in the browser is possible through _prompts_.

```js
window.prompt("Enter Something");
```

You'll whatever you type into the prompt dialog, get's printed on the console.
